# CS340

To write maintainable and readable programs, I use modular design, meaningful variable and function names, and clear and thorough commenting. I try to separate my programs functions into clean, clear, and reusable classes and functions.

As a computer scientist, I approach problems by breaking them down into manageable components and focusing on planning, testing, and incremental development. For Grazioso Salvare's dashboard, I analyzed the requirement, designed filtering queries for the rescue types, and verified data integrity before rendering it in UI components. In the future, I would like to apply more modular development development, version control, and use test cases.

Computer scientists design, build, and improve software systems that solve real-world problems. This project is an example of a well designed system helping a company identify and deploy rescue dogs more efficiently.
